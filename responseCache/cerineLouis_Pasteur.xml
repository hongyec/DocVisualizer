        <p>Louis Pasteur ForMemRS (/?lu?i pae?st??r/, French: [lwi pastoe?]; 27 December 1822 - 28 September 1895) was a French chemist and microbiologist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation, and pasteurization. His research in chemistry led to remarkable breakthroughs in the understanding of the causes and preventions of diseases, which laid down the foundations of hygiene, public health and much of modern medicine.[7] His works are credited to saving millions of lives through the developments of vaccines for rabies and anthrax. He is regarded as one of the founders of modern bacteriology and has been honoured as the "father of bacteriology"[8] and as the "father of microbiology"[9][10] (together with Robert Koch,[11][12] and the latter epithet also attributed to Antonie van Leeuwenhoek[13]). Pasteur was responsible for disproving the doctrine of spontaneous generation. Under the auspices of the French Academy of Sciences, his experiment demonstrated that in sterilized and sealed flasks, nothing ever developed; and, conversely, in sterilized but open flasks, microorganisms could grow.[14] For this experiment, the academy awarded him the Alhumbert Prize carrying 2,500 francs in 1862.</p>

        Pasteur is also regarded as one of the fathers of germ theory
of diseases, which was a minor medical concept at the
time.[15] His many experiments showed that diseases could be
prevented by killing or stopping germs, thereby directly
supporting the germ theory and its application in clinical
medicine. He is best known to the general public for his
invention of the technique of treating milk and wine to stop
bacterial contamination, a process now called pasteurization.
Pasteur also made significant discoveries in chemistry, most
notably on the molecular basis for the asymmetry of certain
crystals and racemization. Early in his career, his
investigation of tartaric acid resulted in the first resolution of
what is now called optical isomers. His work led the way to
the current understanding of a fundamental principle in the
structure of organic compounds.

      <title>Career</title>
      <p>Pasteur was appointed professor of chemistry at the University
of Strasbourg in 1848, and became the chair of chemistry in
1852.[38] In 1854, he was named dean of the new faculty of
sciences at University of Lille, where he began his studies on
fermentation.[39] It was on this occasion that Pasteur uttered
his oft-quoted remark: "dans les champs de l'observation, le
hasard ne favorise que les esprits préparés" ("In the field of
observation, chance favors only the prepared mind").[40]
In 1857, he moved to Paris as the director of scientific studies
at the École Normale Supérieure where he took control from
1858 to 1867 and introduced a series of reforms to improve the
standard of scientific work. The examinations became more
rigid, which led to better results, greater competition, and
increased prestige. Many of his decrees, however, were rigid
and authoritarian, leading to two serious student revolts.</p>
      <p>During "the bean revolt" he decreed that a mutton stew, which
students had refused to eat, would be served and eaten every
Monday. On another occasion he threatened to expel any
student caught smoking, and 73 of the 80 students in the
school resigned.[41]
Louis Pasteur, French biologist and
chemist, 1878, by A Gerschel
In 1863, he was appointed professor of geology, physics, and chemistry at the École nationale
supérieure des Beaux-Arts, a position he held until his resignation in 1867. In 1867, he became the
chair of organic chemistry at the Sorbonne,[42] but he later gave up the position because of poor
health.[43] In 1867, the École Normale's laboratory of physiological chemistry was created at
Pasteur's request,[42] and he was the laboratory's director from 1867 to 1888.[44] In Paris, he
established the Pasteur Institute in 1887, in which he was its director for the rest of his life.[9][45]</p>

      <title>Research</title>
      <p>Pasteur separated the left and right
crystal shapes from each other to
form two piles of crystals: in solution
one form rotated light to the left, the
other to the right, while an equal
mixture of the two forms canceled
each other's effect, and does not
rotate the polarized light.</p>
      <p>Molecular asymmetry</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>In Pasteur's early work as a chemist, beginning at the École</title>
        <p>
          Normale Supérieure, and continuing at Strasbourg and Lille,
he examined the chemical, optical and crystallographic
properties of a group of compounds known as tartrates.[46]
He resolved a problem concerning the nature of tartaric acid in
1848.[47][48][49][
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">50</xref>
          ] A solution of this compound derived from
living things rotated the plane of polarization of light passing
through it.[46] The problem was that tartaric acid derived by
chemical synthesis had no such effect, even though its
chemical reactions were identical and its elemental
composition was the same.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">51</xref>
          ]
Pasteur noticed that crystals of tartrates had small faces. Then
he observed that, in racemic mixtures of tartrates, half of the
crystals were right-handed and half were left-handed. In
solution, the right-handed compound was dextrorotatory, and
the left-handed one was levorotatory.[46] Pasteur determined
that optical activity related to the shape of the crystals, and
that an asymmetric internal arrangement of the molecules of the compound was responsible for
twisting the light.[39] The (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)- tartrates were isometric, non-superposable mirror
images of each other. This was the first time anyone had demonstrated molecular chirality, and
also the first explanation of isomerism.[46]
Some historians consider Pasteur's work in this area to be his "most profound and most original
contributions to science", and his "greatest scientific discovery."[46]
Fermentation and germ theory of diseases
Pasteur was motivated to investigate fermentation while working at Lille. In 1856 a local wine
manufacturer, M. Bigot, whose son was one of Pasteur's students, sought for his advice on the
problems of making beetroot alcohol and souring.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">52</xref>
          ][7]
According to his son-in-law, René Vallery-Radot, in August 1857 Pasteur sent a paper about lactic
acid fermentation to the Société des Sciences de Lille, but the paper was read three months
later.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">53</xref>
          ] A memoire was subsequently published on 30 November 1857.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">54</xref>
          ] In the memoir, he
developed his ideas stating that: "I intend to establish that, just as there is an alcoholic ferment, the
yeast of beer, which is found everywhere that sugar is decomposed into alcohol and carbonic acid,
so also there is a particular ferment, a lactic yeast, always present when sugar becomes lactic
acid."[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">55</xref>
          ]
Pasteur also wrote about alcoholic fermentation.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">56</xref>
          ] It was published in full form in 1858.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">57</xref>
          ][
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">58</xref>
          ]
Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Justus von Liebig had proposed the theory that fermentation was caused
by decomposition. Pasteur demonstrated that this theory was incorrect, and that yeast was
responsible for fermentation to produce alcohol from sugar.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">59</xref>
          ] He also demonstrated that, when a
different microorganism contaminated the wine, lactic acid was produced, making the wine sour.[7]
In 1861, Pasteur observed that less sugar fermented per part of yeast when the yeast was exposed to
air.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">59</xref>
          ] The lower rate of fermentation aerobically became known as the Pasteur effect.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">60</xref>
          ]
Pasteur's research also
showed that the growth of
micro-organisms was
responsible for spoiling
beverages, such as beer,
wine and milk. With this
established, he invented a
process in which liquids
such as milk were heated
to a temperature between
60 and 100 °C.[

1865.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">61</xref>
          ] The method became known as pasteurization, and
was soon applied to beer and milk.[

Beverage contamination led Pasteur to the idea that micro-organisms infecting animals and
humans cause disease. He proposed preventing the entry of micro-organisms into the human body,
leading Joseph Lister to develop antiseptic methods in surgery.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37 ref38">64</xref>
          ]
In 1866, Pasteur published Etudes sur le Vin, about the diseases of wine, and he published Etudes
sur la Bière in 1876, concerning the diseases of beer.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">59</xref>
          ]
In the early 19th century, Agostino Bassi had shown that muscardine was caused by a fungus that
infected silkworms.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">65</xref>
          ] Since 1853, two diseases called pébrine and flacherie had been infecting
great numbers of silkworms in southern France, and by 1865 they were causing huge losses to
farmers. In 1865, Pasteur went to Alès and worked for five years until 1870.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">66</xref>
          ][
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">67</xref>
          ]
Silkworms with pébrine were covered in corpuscles. In the first three years, Pasteur thought that
the corpuscles were a symptom of the disease. In 1870, he concluded that the corpuscles were the
cause of pébrine (it is now known that the cause is a microsporidian).[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">65</xref>
          ] Pasteur also showed that
the disease was hereditary.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">68</xref>
          ] Pasteur developed a system to prevent pébrine: after the female
moths laid their eggs, the moths were turned into a pulp. The pulp was examined with a
microscope, and if corpuscles were observed, the eggs were destroyed.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">69</xref>
          ][
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">68</xref>
          ] Pasteur concluded
that bacteria caused flacherie. The primary cause is currently thought to be viruses.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">65</xref>
          ] The spread
of flacherie could be accidental or hereditary. Hygiene could be used to prevent accidental
flacherie. Moths whose digestive cavities did not contain the microorganisms causing flacherie
were used to lay eggs, preventing hereditary flacherie.[

lower at higher altitudes, showing that air at high altitudes contained less dust and fewer
organisms.[7][

allowed to enter the flask via a long curving tube that made dust particles stick to it. Nothing grew
in the broths unless the flasks were tilted, making the liquid touch the contaminated walls of the
neck. This showed that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, on dust,

These were some of the most important experiments disproving the theory of spontaneous

            Pasteur's first work on vaccine development was on chicken cholera. He received the bacteria
samples (later called Pasteurella multocida after him) from Henry Toussaint.[
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">80</xref>
            ] He started the

            ] After
another year of continuous culturing, he found that the bacteria were less pathogenic. Some of his
culture samples could no longer induce the disease in healthy chickens. In 1879, Pasteur, planning
for holiday, instructed his assistant, Charles Chamberland to inoculate the chickens with fresh
bacteria culture. Chamberland forgot and went on holiday himself. On his return, he injected the
month-old cultures to healthy chickens. The chickens showed some symptoms of infection, but
instead of the infections being fatal, as they usually were, the chickens recovered completely.
Chamberland assumed an error had been made, and wanted to discard the apparently faulty
culture, but Pasteur stopped him.[82][

In December 1880, Pasteur presented his results to the French Academy of Sciences as "Sur les
maladies virulentes et en particulier sur la maladie appelée vulgairement choléra des poules (On
virulent diseases, and in particular on the disease commonly called chicken cholera)" and
published it in the academy's journal (Comptes-Rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie
des Sciences). He attributed that the bacteria were weakened by contact with oxygen.[

            ] He
explained that bacteria kept in sealed containers never lost their virulence, and only those exposed
to air in culture media could be used as vaccine. Pasteur introduced the term "attenuation" for this
weakening of virulence as he presented before the academy, saying:
          </p>
          <p>
            We can diminish the microbe?s virulence by changing the mode of culturing. This is the
crucial point of my subject. I ask the Academy not to criticize, for the time being, the
confidence of my proceedings that permit me to determine the microbe?s attenuation,
in order to save the independence of my studies and to better assure their progress...
[In conclusion] I would like to point out to the Academy two main consequences to the
facts presented: the hope to culture all microbes and to find a vaccine for all infectious
diseases that have repeatedly afflicted humanity, and are a major burden on agriculture
and breeding of domestic animals.[

            In the 1870s, he applied this immunization method to anthrax, which affected cattle, and aroused
interest in combating other diseases. Pasteur cultivated bacteria from the blood of animals infected
with anthrax. When he inoculated animals with the bacteria, anthrax occurred, proving that the
bacteria was the cause of the disease.[

Pasteur was told that sheep that died from anthrax were buried in the field. Pasteur thought that
earthworms might have brought the bacteria to the surface. He found anthrax bacteria in
earthworms' excrement, showing that he was correct.[

            ]
On 12 July 1880, Henri Bouley read before the French Academy of Sciences a report from Henry
Toussaint, a veterinary surgeon, who was not member of the academy. Toussaint had developed
anthrax vaccine by killing the bacilli by heating at 55°C for 10 ?minutes. He tested on eight dogs and
11 sheep, half of which died after inoculation. It was not a great success. Upon hearing the news,
Pasteur immediately wrote to the academy that he could not believe that dead vaccine would work
and that Toussaint's claim "overturns all the ideas I had on viruses, vaccines, etc."[
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">85</xref>
            ] Following
Pasteur's criticism, Toussaint switched to carbolic acid to kill anthrax bacilli and tested the vaccine
on sheep in August 1880. Pasteur thought that this type of killed vaccine should not work because
he believed that attenuated bacteria used up nutrients that the bacteria needed to grow. He
thought oxidizing bacteria made them less virulent.[
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">88</xref>

But Pasteur found that anthrax bacillus was not easily weakened by culturing in air as it formed
spores ? unlike chicken cholera bacillus. In early 1881, he discovered that growing anthrax bacilli
at about 42 °C made them unable to produce spores,[
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">89</xref>
            ] and he described this method in a speech
to the French Academy of Sciences on 28 February.[

            ] On 21 March, he announced successful
vaccination of sheep. To this news, veterinarian Hippolyte Rossignol proposed that the Société
d'agriculture de Melun organize an experiment to test Pasteur's vaccine. Pasteur signed agreement
of the challenge on 28 April. A public experiment was conducted in May at Pouilly-le-Fort. 58
sheep, 2 goats and 10 cattle were used, half of which were given the vaccine on 5 and 17 May; while
the other half was untreated.[

anthrax bacillus on 31 May. The official result was observed and analysed on 2 June in the presence
of over 200 spectators. All cattle survived, vaccinated or not, as Pasteur had bravely predicted: "I
hypothesized that the six vaccinated cows would not become
very ill, while the four unvaccinated cows would perish or at

had been known for a long time for smallpox. Inoculation with smallpox (variolation) was known

naturally acquired disease.[

had spread to most of Europe.[

The difference between smallpox vaccination and anthrax or chicken cholera vaccination was that
the latter two disease organisms had been artificially weakened, so a naturally weak form of the
disease organism did not need to be found.[

that Pasteur had used impure cultures and made errors. In 1882, Pasteur replied to Koch in a
speech, to which Koch responded aggressively.[15] Koch stated that Pasteur tested his vaccine on
unsuitable animals and that Pasteur's research was not properly scientific.[7] In 1882, Koch wrote
"On the Anthrax Inoculation", in which he refuted several of Pasteur's conclusions about anthrax
and criticized Pasteur for keeping his methods secret, jumping to conclusions, and being imprecise.
In 1883, Pasteur wrote that he used cultures prepared in a similar way to his successful
fermentation experiments and that Koch misinterpreted statistics and ignored Pasteur's work on

Fermentation
Scientists before Pasteur had studied fermentation. In the 1830s, Charles Cagniard-Latour,
Friedrich Traugott Kützing and Theodor Schwann used microscopes to study yeasts and concluded
that yeasts were living organisms. In 1839, Justus von Liebig, Friedrich Wöhler and Jöns Jacob
Berzelius stated that yeast was not an organism and was produced when air acted on plant
juice.[

bring any novel idea or experiments. On the other hand, Béchamp was probably aware of Pasteur's
1857 preliminary works. With both scientists claiming priority on the discovery, a dispute,
extending to several areas, lasted throughout their lives.[

Béchamp proposed the incorrect theory of microzymes. According to K. L. Manchester,
antivivisectionists and proponents of alternative medicine promoted Béchamp and microzymes,
unjustifiably claiming that Pasteur plagiarized Béchamp.[

Pasteur thought that succinic acid inverted sucrose. In 1860, Marcellin Berthelot isolated invertase
and showed that succinic acid did not invert sucrose.[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">59</xref>
        ] Pasteur believed that fermentation was
only due to living cells. He and Berthelot engaged in a long argument subject of vitalism, in which
Berthelot was vehemently opposed to any idea of vitalism.[124] Hans Buchner discovered that
zymase catalyzed fermentation, showing that fermentation was catalyzed by enzymes within
cells.[125] Eduard Buchner also discovered that fermentation could take place outside living
cells.[126]
Anthrax vaccine
Pasteur publicly claimed his success in developing the anthrax vaccine in 1881.[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref79">107</xref>
        ] However, his
admirer-turned-rival Henry Toussaint was the one who developed the first vaccine. Toussaint
isolated the bacteria that caused chicken cholera (later named Pasteurella in honour of Pasteur) in
1879 and gave samples to Pasteur who used them for his own works.[127] On 12 July 1880,
Toussaint presented his successful result to the French Academy of Sciences, using an attenuated
vaccine against anthrax in dogs and sheep.[128] Pasteur on grounds of jealousy contested the
discovery by publicly displaying his vaccination method at Pouilly-le-Fort on 5 May 1881.[129]
Pasteur then gave a misleading account of the preparation of the anthrax vaccine used in the
experiment. He claimed that he made "live vaccine", but used potassium dichromate[16] to kill the
vaccine, a method similar to Toussaint's. The promotional experiment was a success and helped
Pasteur sell his products, getting the benefits and glory.[129][130][131]
      </p>
      <p>
        Experimental ethics
Pasteur experiments are often cited as against medical ethics, especially on his vaccination of
Meister. He did not have any experience in medical practice, and more importantly, lacked a
medical license. This is often cited as a serious threat to his professional and personal
reputation.[132][133] His closest partner Émile Roux, who had medical qualifications, refused to
participate in the clinical trial, likely because he considered it unjust.[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77 ref78">106</xref>
        ] However, Pasteur
executed vaccination of the boy under the close watch of practising physicians Jacques-Joseph
Grancher, head of the Paris Children's Hospital's paediatric clinic, and Alfred Vulpian, a member of
the Commission on Rabies. He was not allowed to hold the syringe, although the inoculations were
entirely under his supervision.[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">105</xref>
        ] It was Grancher who was responsible for the injections, and he
defended Pasteur before the French National Academy of Medicine in the issue.[134]
Pasteur has also been criticized for keeping secrecy of his procedure and not giving proper
preclinical trials on animals.[7] Pasteur stated that he kept his procedure secret in order to control its
quality. He later disclosed his procedures to a small group of scientists. Pasteur wrote that he had
successfully vaccinated 50 rabid dogs before using it on Meister.[135][136][137] According to Geison,
Pasteur's laboratory notebooks show that he had vaccinated only 11 dogs.[7]
Meister never showed any symptoms of rabies,[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77 ref78">106</xref>
        ] but the vaccination has not been proved to be
the reason. One source estimates the probability of Meister contracting rabies at 10%.[

        Pasteur was awarded 1,500 francs in 1853 by the Pharmaceutical Society for the synthesis of
racemic acid.[138] In 1856 the Royal Society of London presented him the Rumford Medal for his
discovery of the nature of racemic acid and its relations to polarized light,[139] and the Copley
Medal in 1874 for his work on fermentation.[140] He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal
Society (ForMemRS) in 1869.[

1861 for membership to the French Academy of Sciences, he won the 1862 election for membership
to the mineralogy section.[142] He was elected to permanent secretary of the physical science
section of the academy in 1887 and held the position until 1889.[143]
In 1873 Pasteur was elected to the Académie Nationale de Médecine[144] and was made the
commander in the Brazilian Order of the Rose.[145] In 1881 he was elected to a seat at the Académie
française left vacant by Émile Littré.[146] Pasteur received the Albert Medal from the Royal Society
of Arts in 1882.[147] In 1883 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts
and Sciences.[148] In 1885, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.[149]
On 8 June 1886, the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II awarded Pasteur with the Order of the

Pasteur Institute
After developing the rabies vaccine, Pasteur proposed an
institute for the vaccine.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">158</xref>
          ] In 1887, fundraising for the Pasteur Institute began, with donations
from many countries. The official statute was registered in 1887, stating that the institute's
purposes were "the treatment of rabies according to the method developed by M. Pasteur" and "the
study of virulent and contagious diseases".[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">105</xref>
          ] The institute was inaugurated on 14 November
1888.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">105</xref>
          ] He brought together scientists with various specialties. The first five departments were
directed by two graduates of the École Normale Supérieure: Émile Duclaux (general microbiology
research) and Charles Chamberland (microbe research applied to hygiene), as well as a biologist,
Élie Metchnikoff (morphological microbe research) and two physicians, Jacques-Joseph Grancher
(rabies) and Émile Roux (technical microbe research). One year after the inauguration of the
institute, Roux set up the first course of microbiology ever taught in the world, then entitled Cours
de Microbie Technique (Course of microbe research techniques). Since 1891 the Pasteur Institute
had been extended to different countries, and currently there are 32 institutes in 29 countries in
various parts of the world.[159]

        Faith and spirituality
Pasteur married Marie Pasteur (née Laurent) in 1849. She was the daughter of the rector of the
University of Strasbourg, and was Pasteur's scientific assistant. They had five children together,
only three of whom survived until adulthood. [160]
His grandson, Louis Pasteur Vallery-Radot, wrote that Pasteur had kept from his Catholic
background only a spiritualism without religious practice.[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101">161</xref>
        ] However, Catholic observers often
said that Pasteur remained an ardent Christian throughout his whole life, and his son-in-law wrote,
in a biography of him:
Absolute faith in God and in Eternity, and a conviction that the power for good given to
us in this world will be continued beyond it, were feelings which pervaded his whole
life; the virtues of the gospel had ever been present to him. Full of respect for the form
of religion which had been that of his forefathers, he came simply to it and naturally for
spiritual help in these last weeks of his life.[162]
The Literary Digest of 18 October 1902 gives this statement from Pasteur that he prayed while he
worked:
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-7-1">
        <title>Posterity will one day laugh at the foolishness of</title>
        <p>modern materialistic philosophers. The more I
study nature, the more I stand amazed at the work
of the Creator. I pray while I am engaged at my
work in the laboratory.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-7-2">
        <title>Maurice Vallery-Radot, grandson of the brother of the son-in</title>
        <p>
          law of Pasteur and outspoken Catholic, also holds that Pasteur
fundamentally remained Catholic.[163] According to both
Pasteur Vallery-Radot and Maurice Vallery-Radot, the
following well-known quotation attributed to Pasteur is
apocryphal:[164] "The more I know, the more nearly is my faith
that of the Breton peasant. Could I but know all I would have
the faith of a Breton peasant's wife".[18] According to Maurice
Vallery-Radot,[165] the false quotation appeared for the first
time shortly after the death of Pasteur.[166] However, despite
his belief in God, it has been said that his views were that of a
freethinker rather than a Catholic, a spiritual more than a
religious man.[167][168] He was also against mixing science
with religion.[169][170]
Death
Pasteur in 1857
In 1868, Pasteur suffered a severe brain stroke that paralysed the left side of his body, but he
recovered.[171] A stroke or uremia in 1894 severely impaired his health.[172][173][174] Failing to fully
recover, he died on 28 September 1895, near Paris.[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">51</xref>
          ] He was given a state funeral and was buried
in the Cathedral of Notre Dame, but his remains were reinterred in the Pasteur Institute in
Paris,[175] in a vault covered in depictions of his accomplishments in Byzantine mosaics.[176]
