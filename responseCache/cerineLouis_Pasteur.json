{"title": "Louis Pasteur", "abstract": "Louis Pasteur ForMemRS (/?lu?i pae?st??r/, French: [lwi pastoe?]; 27 December 1822 - 28 September 1895) was a French chemist and microbiologist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation, and pasteurization. His research in chemistry led to remarkable breakthroughs in the understanding of the causes and preventions of diseases, which laid down the foundations of hygiene, public health and much of modern medicine.[7] His works are credited to saving millions of lives through the developments of vaccines for rabies and anthrax. He is regarded as one of the founders of modern bacteriology and has been honoured as the \"father of bacteriology\"[8] and as the \"father of microbiology\"[9][10] (together with Robert Koch,[11][12] and the latter epithet also attributed to Antonie van Leeuwenhoek[13]). Pasteur was responsible for disproving the doctrine of spontaneous generation. Under the auspices of the French Academy of Sciences, his experiment demonstrated that in sterilized and sealed flasks, nothing ever developed; and, conversely, in sterilized but open flasks, microorganisms could grow.[14] For this experiment, the academy awarded him the Alhumbert Prize carrying 2,500 francs in 1862.</p>", "-": "\n        Pasteur is also regarded as one of the fathers of germ theory\nof diseases, which was a minor medical concept at the\ntime.[15] His many experiments showed that diseases could be\nprevented by killing or stopping germs, thereby directly\nsupporting the germ theory and its application in clinical\nmedicine. He is best known to the general public for his\ninvention of the technique of treating milk and wine to stop\nbacterial contamination, a process now called pasteurization.\nPasteur also made significant discoveries in chemistry, most\nnotably on the molecular basis for the asymmetry of certain\ncrystals and racemization. Early in his career, his\ninvestigation of tartaric acid resulted in the first resolution of\nwhat is now called optical isomers. His work led the way to\nthe current understanding of a fundamental principle in the\nstructure of organic compounds.\n(aged 72)\nMarnes-la-Coquette,\nFrance\nMathematics,[\n        \n        ] Docteur\n\u00e8s Sciences (Chemical\nPhysics)[\n        \n        ]\nSup\u00e9rieure\n      University of Paris\nNationality French\nEducation\nAlma mater \u00c9cole Normale\nKnown for Created the first\nvaccines for rabies\nHe was the director of the Pasteur Institute, established in\n1887, until his death, and his body was interred in a vault\nbeneath the institute.

He also attended classes\nat the Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Louis and lectures of Jean-Baptiste Dumas at the Sorbonne.[\n            \n            ] In 1843, he\npassed the test with a high ranking and entered the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure.[\n            \n            ] In 1845 he\nreceived the licenci\u00e9 \u00e8s sciences degree.[\n            \n            ] In 1846, he was appointed professor of physics at the\nColl\u00e8ge de Tournon (now called Lyc\u00e9e Gabriel-Faure) in Ard\u00e8che.

They were married on 29 May 1849,[36] and together had five\nchildren, only two of whom survived to adulthood;[37] the other three died of typhoid.\n          ", "Education and early life": "", "Career": "Pasteur was appointed professor of chemistry at the University\nof Strasbourg in 1848, and became the chair of chemistry in\n1852.[38] In 1854, he was named dean of the new faculty of\nsciences at University of Lille, where he began his studies on\nfermentation.[39] It was on this occasion that Pasteur uttered\nhis oft-quoted remark: \"dans les champs de l'observation, le\nhasard ne favorise que les esprits pr\u00e9par\u00e9s\" (\"In the field of\nobservation, chance favors only the prepared mind\").[40]\nIn 1857, he moved to Paris as the director of scientific studies\nat the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure where he took control from\n1858 to 1867 and introduced a series of reforms to improve the\nstandard of scientific work. The examinations became more\nrigid, which led to better results, greater competition, and\nincreased prestige. Many of his decrees, however, were rigid\nand authoritarian, leading to two serious student revolts.During \"the bean revolt\" he decreed that a mutton stew, which\nstudents had refused to eat, would be served and eaten every\nMonday. On another occasion he threatened to expel any\nstudent caught smoking, and 73 of the 80 students in the\nschool resigned.[41]\nLouis Pasteur, French biologist and\nchemist, 1878, by A Gerschel\nIn 1863, he was appointed professor of geology, physics, and chemistry at the \u00c9cole nationale\nsup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts, a position he held until his resignation in 1867. In 1867, he became the\nchair of organic chemistry at the Sorbonne,[42] but he later gave up the position because of poor\nhealth.[43] In 1867, the \u00c9cole Normale's laboratory of physiological chemistry was created at\nPasteur's request,[42] and he was the laboratory's director from 1867 to 1888.[44] In Paris, he\nestablished the Pasteur Institute in 1887, in which he was its director for the rest of his life.[9][45]", "Research": "Pasteur separated the left and right\ncrystal shapes from each other to\nform two piles of crystals: in solution\none form rotated light to the left, the\nother to the right, while an equal\nmixture of the two forms canceled\neach other's effect, and does not\nrotate the polarized light.Molecular asymmetry\n          Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and continuing at Strasbourg and Lille,\nhe examined the chemical, optical and crystallographic\nproperties of a group of compounds known as tartrates.[46]\nHe resolved a problem concerning the nature of tartaric acid in\n1848.[47][48][49][\n          \n          ] A solution of this compound derived from\nliving things rotated the plane of polarization of light passing\nthrough it.[46] The problem was that tartaric acid derived by\nchemical synthesis had no such effect, even though its\nchemical reactions were identical and its elemental\ncomposition was the same.[\n          \n          ]\nPasteur noticed that crystals of tartrates had small faces. Then\nhe observed that, in racemic mixtures of tartrates, half of the\ncrystals were right-handed and half were left-handed. In\nsolution, the right-handed compound was dextrorotatory, and\nthe left-handed one was levorotatory.[46] Pasteur determined\nthat optical activity related to the shape of the crystals, and\nthat an asymmetric internal arrangement of the molecules of the compound was responsible for\ntwisting the light.[39] The (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)- tartrates were isometric, non-superposable mirror\nimages of each other. This was the first time anyone had demonstrated molecular chirality, and\nalso the first explanation of isomerism.[46]\nSome historians consider Pasteur's work in this area to be his \"most profound and most original\ncontributions to science\", and his \"greatest scientific discovery.\"[46]\nFermentation and germ theory of diseases\nPasteur was motivated to investigate fermentation while working at Lille. In 1856 a local wine\nmanufacturer, M. Bigot, whose son was one of Pasteur's students, sought for his advice on the\nproblems of making beetroot alcohol and souring.[\n          \n          ][7]\nAccording to his son-in-law, Ren\u00e9 Vallery-Radot, in August 1857 Pasteur sent a paper about lactic\nacid fermentation to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Sciences de Lille, but the paper was read three months\nlater.[\n          \n          ] A memoire was subsequently published on 30 November 1857.[\n          \n          ] In the memoir, he\ndeveloped his ideas stating that: \"I intend to establish that, just as there is an alcoholic ferment, the\nyeast of beer, which is found everywhere that sugar is decomposed into alcohol and carbonic acid,\nso also there is a particular ferment, a lactic yeast, always present when sugar becomes lactic\nacid.\"[\n          \n          ]\nPasteur also wrote about alcoholic fermentation.[\n          \n          ] It was published in full form in 1858.[\n          \n          ][\n          \n          ]\nJ\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius and Justus von Liebig had proposed the theory that fermentation was caused\nby decomposition. Pasteur demonstrated that this theory was incorrect, and that yeast was\nresponsible for fermentation to produce alcohol from sugar.[\n          \n          ] He also demonstrated that, when a\ndifferent microorganism contaminated the wine, lactic acid was produced, making the wine sour.[7]\nIn 1861, Pasteur observed that less sugar fermented per part of yeast when the yeast was exposed to\nair.[\n          \n          ] The lower rate of fermentation aerobically became known as the Pasteur effect.[\n          \n          ]\nPasteur's research also\nshowed that the growth of\nmicro-organisms was\nresponsible for spoiling\nbeverages, such as beer,\nwine and milk. With this\nestablished, he invented a\nprocess in which liquids\nsuch as milk were heated\nto a temperature between\n60 and 100 \u00b0C.[\n          \n          ] This\nkilled most bacteria and\nmoulds already present\nPasteur experimenting in his within them. Pasteur and\nlaboratory. Claude Bernard completed\ntests on blood and urine\non 20 April 1862.[\n          \n          ]\nPasteur patented the process, to fight the \"diseases\" of wine, in\n1865.[\n          \n          ] The method became known as pasteurization, and\nwas soon applied to beer and milk.[\n          \n          ]\nInstitut Pasteur de Lille\nBeverage contamination led Pasteur to the idea that micro-organisms infecting animals and\nhumans cause disease. He proposed preventing the entry of micro-organisms into the human body,\nleading Joseph Lister to develop antiseptic methods in surgery.[\n          \n          ]\nIn 1866, Pasteur published Etudes sur le Vin, about the diseases of wine, and he published Etudes\nsur la Bi\u00e8re in 1876, concerning the diseases of beer.[\n          \n          ]\nIn the early 19th century, Agostino Bassi had shown that muscardine was caused by a fungus that\ninfected silkworms.[\n          \n          ] Since 1853, two diseases called p\u00e9brine and flacherie had been infecting\ngreat numbers of silkworms in southern France, and by 1865 they were causing huge losses to\nfarmers. In 1865, Pasteur went to Al\u00e8s and worked for five years until 1870.[\n          \n          ][\n          \n          ]\nSilkworms with p\u00e9brine were covered in corpuscles. In the first three years, Pasteur thought that\nthe corpuscles were a symptom of the disease. In 1870, he concluded that the corpuscles were the\ncause of p\u00e9brine (it is now known that the cause is a microsporidian).[\n          \n          ] Pasteur also showed that\nthe disease was hereditary.[\n          \n          ] Pasteur developed a system to prevent p\u00e9brine: after the female\nmoths laid their eggs, the moths were turned into a pulp. The pulp was examined with a\nmicroscope, and if corpuscles were observed, the eggs were destroyed.[\n          \n          ][\n          \n          ] Pasteur concluded\nthat bacteria caused flacherie. The primary cause is currently thought to be viruses.[\n          \n          ] The spread\nof flacherie could be accidental or hereditary. Hygiene could be used to prevent accidental\nflacherie. Moths whose digestive cavities did not contain the microorganisms causing flacherie\nwere used to lay eggs, preventing hereditary flacherie.[\n          \n          ]\nSpontaneous generation\n        demonstrated that the skin of grapes was the natural source of\nyeasts, and that sterilized grapes and grape juice never\nfermented. He drew grape juice from under the skin with\nsterilized needles, and also covered grapes with sterilized cloth.\nBoth experiments could not produce wine in sterilized\ncontainers.[7]\n          spontaneous generation. He received a particularly stern\ncriticism from F\u00e9lix Archim\u00e8de Pouchet, who was director of\nthe Rouen Museum of Natural History. To settle the debate\nbetween the eminent scientists, the French Academy of\nSciences offered the Alhumbert Prize carrying 2,500 francs to\nwhoever could experimentally demonstrate for or against the\ndoctrine.[\n          \n          ][\n          \n          ][\n          \n          ]\n        \n          generation of living organisms in liquids.[\n          \n          ] In the late 1850s,\nhe performed experiments and claimed that they were\nevidence of spontaneous generation.[\n          \n          ][\n          \n          ] Francesco Redi and\nLazzaro Spallanzani had provided some evidence against\nspontaneous generation in the 17th and 18th centuries,\nrespectively. Spallanzani's experiments in 1765 suggested that\nair contaminated broths with bacteria. In the 1860s, Pasteur\nrepeated Spallanzani's experiments, but Pouchet reported a\ndifferent result using a different broth.[\n          \n          ]\n        \n          spontaneous generation. He placed boiled liquid in a flask and\nlet hot air enter the flask. Then he closed the flask, and no\norganisms grew in it.[\n          \n          ] In another experiment, when he\nopened flasks containing boiled liquid, dust entered the flasks,\nBottle en col de cygne (swan-neck\nbottle) used by Pasteur\nLouis Pasteur?s pasteurization\nexperiment illustrates the fact that\nthe spoilage of liquid was caused by\nparticles in the air rather than the air\nitself. These experiments were\nimportant pieces of evidence\nsupporting the germ theory of\ndisease.\ncausing organisms to grow in some of them. The number of flasks in which organisms grew was\nlower at higher altitudes, showing that air at high altitudes contained less dust and fewer\norganisms.[7][\n          \n          ] Pasteur also used swan neck flasks containing a fermentable liquid. Air was\nallowed to enter the flask via a long curving tube that made dust particles stick to it. Nothing grew\nin the broths unless the flasks were tilted, making the liquid touch the contaminated walls of the\nneck. This showed that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, on dust,\nrather than spontaneously generating within the liquid or from the action of pure air.[7][\n          \n          ]\nThese were some of the most important experiments disproving the theory of spontaneous\ngeneration. Pasteur gave a series of five presentations of his findings before the French Academy of\nSciences in 1881, which were published in 1882 as M\u00e9moire Sur les corpuscules organis\u00e9s qui\nexistent dans l'atmosph\u00e8re: Examen de la doctrine des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations spontan\u00e9es (Account of\nOrganized Corpuscles Existing in the Atmosphere: Examining the Doctrine of Spontaneous\nGeneration).[\n          \n          ][\n          \n          ] Pasteur won the Alhumbert Prize in 1862.[\n          \n          ] He concluded that:\nNever will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow of this\nsimple experiment. There is no known circumstance in which it can be confirmed that\nmicroscopic beings came into the world without germs, without parents similar to\nthemselves.[7][\n          \n          ]\nImmunology and vaccination\n        \n            Pasteur's first work on vaccine development was on chicken cholera. He received the bacteria\nsamples (later called Pasteurella multocida after him) from Henry Toussaint.[\n            \n            ] He started the\nstudy in 1877, and by the next year, was able to maintain a stable culture using broths.[\n            \n            ] After\nanother year of continuous culturing, he found that the bacteria were less pathogenic. Some of his\nculture samples could no longer induce the disease in healthy chickens. In 1879, Pasteur, planning\nfor holiday, instructed his assistant, Charles Chamberland to inoculate the chickens with fresh\nbacteria culture. Chamberland forgot and went on holiday himself. On his return, he injected the\nmonth-old cultures to healthy chickens. The chickens showed some symptoms of infection, but\ninstead of the infections being fatal, as they usually were, the chickens recovered completely.\nChamberland assumed an error had been made, and wanted to discard the apparently faulty\nculture, but Pasteur stopped him.[82][\n            \n            ] Pasteur injected the freshly recovered chickens with fresh\nbacteria (that normally would kill other chickens), the chickens no longer showed any sign of\ninfection. It was clear to him that the weakened bacteria had caused the chickens to become\nimmune to the disease.[\n            \n            ][\n            \n            ]\nIn December 1880, Pasteur presented his results to the French Academy of Sciences as \"Sur les\nmaladies virulentes et en particulier sur la maladie appel\u00e9e vulgairement chol\u00e9ra des poules (On\nvirulent diseases, and in particular on the disease commonly called chicken cholera)\" and\npublished it in the academy's journal (Comptes-Rendus hebdomadaires des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie\ndes Sciences). He attributed that the bacteria were weakened by contact with oxygen.[\n            \n            ] He\nexplained that bacteria kept in sealed containers never lost their virulence, and only those exposed\nto air in culture media could be used as vaccine. Pasteur introduced the term \"attenuation\" for this\nweakening of virulence as he presented before the academy, saying:\n          \n            We can diminish the microbe?s virulence by changing the mode of culturing. This is the\ncrucial point of my subject. I ask the Academy not to criticize, for the time being, the\nconfidence of my proceedings that permit me to determine the microbe?s attenuation,\nin order to save the independence of my studies and to better assure their progress...\n[In conclusion] I would like to point out to the Academy two main consequences to the\nfacts presented: the hope to culture all microbes and to find a vaccine for all infectious\ndiseases that have repeatedly afflicted humanity, and are a major burden on agriculture\nand breeding of domestic animals.[\n            \n            ]\n          \n            In the 1870s, he applied this immunization method to anthrax, which affected cattle, and aroused\ninterest in combating other diseases. Pasteur cultivated bacteria from the blood of animals infected\nwith anthrax. When he inoculated animals with the bacteria, anthrax occurred, proving that the\nbacteria was the cause of the disease.[\n            \n            ] Many cattle were dying of anthrax in \"cursed fields\".[\n            \n            ]\nPasteur was told that sheep that died from anthrax were buried in the field. Pasteur thought that\nearthworms might have brought the bacteria to the surface. He found anthrax bacteria in\nearthworms' excrement, showing that he was correct.[\n            \n            ] He told the farmers not to bury dead\nanimals in the fields.[\n            \n            ] Pasteur had been trying to develop the anthrax vaccine since 1877, soon\nafter Robert Koch's discovery of the bacterium.[\n            \n            ]\nOn 12 July 1880, Henri Bouley read before the French Academy of Sciences a report from Henry\nToussaint, a veterinary surgeon, who was not member of the academy. Toussaint had developed\nanthrax vaccine by killing the bacilli by heating at 55\u00b0C for 10 ?minutes. He tested on eight dogs and\n11 sheep, half of which died after inoculation. It was not a great success. Upon hearing the news,\nPasteur immediately wrote to the academy that he could not believe that dead vaccine would work\nand that Toussaint's claim \"overturns all the ideas I had on viruses, vaccines, etc.\"[\n            \n            ] Following\nPasteur's criticism, Toussaint switched to carbolic acid to kill anthrax bacilli and tested the vaccine\non sheep in August 1880. Pasteur thought that this type of killed vaccine should not work because\nhe believed that attenuated bacteria used up nutrients that the bacteria needed to grow. He\nthought oxidizing bacteria made them less virulent.[\n            \n            ]\nBut Pasteur found that anthrax bacillus was not easily weakened by culturing in air as it formed\nspores ? unlike chicken cholera bacillus. In early 1881, he discovered that growing anthrax bacilli\nat about 42 \u00b0C made them unable to produce spores,[\n            \n            ] and he described this method in a speech\nto the French Academy of Sciences on 28 February.[\n            \n            ] On 21 March, he announced successful\nvaccination of sheep. To this news, veterinarian Hippolyte Rossignol proposed that the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nd'agriculture de Melun organize an experiment to test Pasteur's vaccine. Pasteur signed agreement\nof the challenge on 28 April. A public experiment was conducted in May at Pouilly-le-Fort. 58\nsheep, 2 goats and 10 cattle were used, half of which were given the vaccine on 5 and 17 May; while\nthe other half was untreated.[\n            \n            ] All the animals were injected with the fresh virulent culture of\nanthrax bacillus on 31 May. The official result was observed and analysed on 2 June in the presence\nof over 200 spectators. All cattle survived, vaccinated or not, as Pasteur had bravely predicted: \"I\nhypothesized that the six vaccinated cows would not become\nvery ill, while the four unvaccinated cows would perish or at\nleast become very ill.\"[\n            \n            ] On the other hand, all vaccinated\nsheep and goats survived, while the unvaccinated one either\nhad died or were dying before the viewers.[\n            \n            ] His report to the\n          \n            French Academy of Sciences on 13 June condludes:\nLouis Pasteur in his laboratory,\npainting by A.

Inoculation with smallpox (variolation) was known\nto result in a much less severe disease, and greatly reduced mortality, in comparison with the\nnaturally acquired disease.[\n          \n          ] Edward Jenner had also studied vaccination using cowpox\n(vaccinia) to give cross-immunity to smallpox in the late 1790s, and by the early 1800s vaccination\nhad spread to most of Europe.[\n          \n          ]\nThe difference between smallpox vaccination and anthrax or chicken cholera vaccination was that\nthe latter two disease organisms had been artificially weakened, so a naturally weak form of the\ndisease organism did not need to be found.[\n          \n          ] This discovery revolutionized work in infectious\ndiseases, and Pasteur gave these artificially weakened diseases the generic name of \"vaccines\", in\nhonour of Jenner's discovery.[\n          \n          ]\nIn 1876, Robert Koch had shown that Bacillus anthracis caused anthrax.[\n          \n          ] In his papers\npublished between 1878 and 1880, Pasteur only mentioned Koch's work in a footnote. Koch met\nPasteur at the Seventh International Medical Congress in 1881. A few months later, Koch wrote\nthat Pasteur had used impure cultures and made errors. In 1882, Pasteur replied to Koch in a\nspeech, to which Koch responded aggressively.[15] Koch stated that Pasteur tested his vaccine on\nunsuitable animals and that Pasteur's research was not properly scientific.[7] In 1882, Koch wrote\n\"On the Anthrax Inoculation\", in which he refuted several of Pasteur's conclusions about anthrax\nand criticized Pasteur for keeping his methods secret, jumping to conclusions, and being imprecise.\nIn 1883, Pasteur wrote that he used cultures prepared in a similar way to his successful\nfermentation experiments and that Koch misinterpreted statistics and ignored Pasteur's work on\nsilkworms.[\n          \n          ]\n        \n            In 1882, Pasteur sent his assistant Louis Thuillier to southern France because of an epizootic of\nswine erysipelas.[100] Thuillier identified the bacillus that caused the disease in March 1883.[\n            \n            ]\nPasteur and Thuillier increased the bacillus's virulence after passing it through pigeons. Then they\npassed the bacillus through rabbits, weakening it and obtaining a vaccine. Pasteur and Thuillier\nincorrectly described the bacterium as a figure-eight shape. Roux described the bacterium as\nstickshaped in 1884.[101]\n          \n            Pasteur produced the first vaccine for rabies by growing the virus in rabbits, and then weakening it\nby drying the affected nerve tissue.[\n            \n            ][\n            \n            ] The rabies vaccine was initially created by Emile Roux,\na French doctor and a colleague of Pasteur, who had produced a killed vaccine using this\nmethod.[7] The vaccine had been tested in 50 dogs before its first human trial.[\n            \n            ][\n            \n            ] This vaccine\nwas used on 9-year-old Joseph Meister, on 6 July 1885, after the boy was badly mauled by a rabid\ndog.[\n            \n            ][\n            \n            ] This was done at some personal risk for Pasteur, since he was not a licensed physician\nand could have faced prosecution for treating the boy.[45] After consulting with physicians, he\ndecided to go ahead with the treatment.[\n            \n            ] Over 11 days, Meister received 13 inoculations, each\ninoculation using viruses that had been weakened for a shorter period of time.[\n            \n            ] Three months\nlater he examined Meister and found that he was in good health.[\n            \n            ][\n            \n            ] Pasteur was hailed as a\nhero and the legal matter was not pursued.[45] Analysis of his laboratory notebooks shows that\nPasteur had treated two people before his vaccination of Meister. One survived but may not\nactually have had rabies, and the other died of rabies.[\n            \n            ][\n            \n            ] Pasteur began treatment of\nJeanBaptiste Jupille on 20 October 1885, and the treatment was successful.[\n            \n            ] Later in 1885, people,\nincluding four children from the United States, went to Pasteur's laboratory to be inoculated.[\n            \n            ]\nIn 1886, he treated 350 people, of which only one developed rabies.[\n            \n            ] The treatment's success\nlaid the foundations for the manufacture of many other vaccines. The first of the Pasteur Institutes\nwas also built on the basis of this achievement.[\n            \n            ]\nIn The Story of San Michele, Axel Munthe writes of some risks Pasteur undertook in the rabies\nvaccine research:[\n            \n            ]\n          Pasteur himself was absolutely fearless. Anxious to secure a sample of saliva straight\nfrom the jaws of a rabid dog, I once saw him with the glass tube held between his lips\ndraw a few drops of the deadly saliva from the mouth of a rabid bull-dog, held on the\ntable by two assistants, their hands protected by leather gloves.\n            Because of his study in germs, Pasteur encouraged doctors to sanitize their hands and equipment\nbefore surgery. Prior to this, few doctors or their assistants practiced these procedures.[\n            \n            ][\n            \n            ]\nIgnaz Semmelweis and Joseph Lister had earlier practiced hand sanitizing in medical contexts in\nthe 1860s.[\n            \n            ][\n            \n            ]\n          ", "Controversies": "\n        A French national hero at age 55, in 1878 Pasteur discreetly told his family never to reveal his\nlaboratory notebooks to anyone. His family obeyed, and all his documents were held and inherited\nin secrecy. Finally, in 1964 Pasteur's grandson and last surviving male descendant, Pasteur\nValleryRadot, donated the papers to the French national library. Yet the papers were restricted for\nhistorical studies until the death of Vallery-Radot in 1971. The documents were given a catalogue\nnumber only in 1985.[\n        \n        ]\nIn 1995, the centennial of the death of Louis Pasteur, a historian of science Gerald L. Geison\npublished an analysis of Pasteur's private notebooks in his The Private Science of Louis Pasteur,\nand declared that Pasteur had given several misleading accounts and played deceptions in his most\nimportant discoveries.[16][\n        \n        ] Max Perutz published a defense of Pasteur in The New York Review\nof Books.[\n        \n        ] Based on further examinations of Pasteur's documents, French immunologist Patrice\nDebr\u00e9 concluded in his book Louis Pasteur (1998) that, in spite of his genius, Pasteur had some\nfaults. A book review states that Debr\u00e9 \"sometimes finds him unfair, combative, arrogant,\nunattractive in attitude, inflexible and even dogmatic\".[\n        \n        ][\n        \n        ]\nFermentation\nScientists before Pasteur had studied fermentation. In the 1830s, Charles Cagniard-Latour,\nFriedrich Traugott K\u00fctzing and Theodor Schwann used microscopes to study yeasts and concluded\nthat yeasts were living organisms. In 1839, Justus von Liebig, Friedrich W\u00f6hler and J\u00f6ns Jacob\nBerzelius stated that yeast was not an organism and was produced when air acted on plant\njuice.[\n        \n        ]\nIn 1855, Antoine B\u00e9champ, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Montpellier, conducted\nexperiments with sucrose solutions and concluded that water was the factor for fermentation.[\n        \n        ]\nHe changed his conclusion in 1858, stating that fermentation was directly related to the growth of\nmoulds, which required air for growth. He regarded himself as the first to show the role of\nmicroorganisms in fermentation.[\n        \n        ][\n        \n        ]\nPasteur started his experiments in 1857 and published his findings in 1858 (April issue of Comptes\nRendus Chimie, B\u00e9champ's paper appeared in January issue). B\u00e9champ noted that Pasteur did not\nbring any novel idea or experiments. On the other hand, B\u00e9champ was probably aware of Pasteur's\n1857 preliminary works. With both scientists claiming priority on the discovery, a dispute,\nextending to several areas, lasted throughout their lives.[\n        \n        ][122]\nHowever, B\u00e9champ was on the losing side, as the BMJ obituary remarked: His name was\n\"associated with bygone controversies as to priority which it would be unprofitable to recall\".[123]\nB\u00e9champ proposed the incorrect theory of microzymes. According to K. L. Manchester,\nantivivisectionists and proponents of alternative medicine promoted B\u00e9champ and microzymes,\nunjustifiably claiming that Pasteur plagiarized B\u00e9champ.[\n        \n        ]\nPasteur thought that succinic acid inverted sucrose. In 1860, Marcellin Berthelot isolated invertase\nand showed that succinic acid did not invert sucrose.[\n        \n        ] Pasteur believed that fermentation was\nonly due to living cells. He and Berthelot engaged in a long argument subject of vitalism, in which\nBerthelot was vehemently opposed to any idea of vitalism.[124] Hans Buchner discovered that\nzymase catalyzed fermentation, showing that fermentation was catalyzed by enzymes within\ncells.[125] Eduard Buchner also discovered that fermentation could take place outside living\ncells.[126]\nAnthrax vaccine\nPasteur publicly claimed his success in developing the anthrax vaccine in 1881.[\n        \n        ] However, his\nadmirer-turned-rival Henry Toussaint was the one who developed the first vaccine. Toussaint\nisolated the bacteria that caused chicken cholera (later named Pasteurella in honour of Pasteur) in\n1879 and gave samples to Pasteur who used them for his own works.[127] On 12 July 1880,\nToussaint presented his successful result to the French Academy of Sciences, using an attenuated\nvaccine against anthrax in dogs and sheep.[128] Pasteur on grounds of jealousy contested the\ndiscovery by publicly displaying his vaccination method at Pouilly-le-Fort on 5 May 1881.[129]\nPasteur then gave a misleading account of the preparation of the anthrax vaccine used in the\nexperiment. He claimed that he made \"live vaccine\", but used potassium dichromate[16] to kill the\nvaccine, a method similar to Toussaint's. The promotional experiment was a success and helped\nPasteur sell his products, getting the benefits and glory.[129][130][131]\n      \n        Experimental ethics\nPasteur experiments are often cited as against medical ethics, especially on his vaccination of\nMeister. He did not have any experience in medical practice, and more importantly, lacked a\nmedical license. This is often cited as a serious threat to his professional and personal\nreputation.[132][133] His closest partner \u00c9mile Roux, who had medical qualifications, refused to\nparticipate in the clinical trial, likely because he considered it unjust.[\n        \n        ] However, Pasteur\nexecuted vaccination of the boy under the close watch of practising physicians Jacques-Joseph\nGrancher, head of the Paris Children's Hospital's paediatric clinic, and Alfred Vulpian, a member of\nthe Commission on Rabies. He was not allowed to hold the syringe, although the inoculations were\nentirely under his supervision.[\n        \n        ] It was Grancher who was responsible for the injections, and he\ndefended Pasteur before the French National Academy of Medicine in the issue.[134]\nPasteur has also been criticized for keeping secrecy of his procedure and not giving proper\npreclinical trials on animals.[7] Pasteur stated that he kept his procedure secret in order to control its\nquality. He later disclosed his procedures to a small group of scientists. Pasteur wrote that he had\nsuccessfully vaccinated 50 rabid dogs before using it on Meister.[135][136][137] According to Geison,\nPasteur's laboratory notebooks show that he had vaccinated only 11 dogs.[7]\nMeister never showed any symptoms of rabies,[\n        \n        ] but the vaccination has not been proved to be\nthe reason. One source estimates the probability of Meister contracting rabies at 10%.[\n        \n        ]\n      ", "Awards and honours": "\n        Pasteur was awarded 1,500 francs in 1853 by the Pharmaceutical Society for the synthesis of\nracemic acid.[138] In 1856 the Royal Society of London presented him the Rumford Medal for his\ndiscovery of the nature of racemic acid and its relations to polarized light,[139] and the Copley\nMedal in 1874 for his work on fermentation.[140] He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal\nSociety (ForMemRS) in 1869.[\n        \n        ]\nThe French Academy of Sciences awarded Pasteur the 1859 Montyon Prize for experimental\nphysiology in 1860,[42] and the Jecker Prize in 1861 and the Alhumbert Prize in 1862 for his\nexperimental refutation of spontaneous generation.[\n        \n        ][141] Though he lost elections in 1857 and\n1861 for membership to the French Academy of Sciences, he won the 1862 election for membership\nto the mineralogy section.[142] He was elected to permanent secretary of the physical science\nsection of the academy in 1887 and held the position until 1889.[143]\nIn 1873 Pasteur was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine[144] and was made the\ncommander in the Brazilian Order of the Rose.[145] In 1881 he was elected to a seat at the Acad\u00e9mie\nfran\u00e7aise left vacant by \u00c9mile Littr\u00e9.[146] Pasteur received the Albert Medal from the Royal Society\nof Arts in 1882.[147] In 1883 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts\nand Sciences.[148] In 1885, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.[149]\nOn 8 June 1886, the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II awarded Pasteur with the Order of the\nMedjidie (I Class) and 10000 Ottoman liras.[\n        \n        ] He was awarded the Cameron Prize for\nTherapeutics of the University of Edinburgh in 1889.[\n        \n        ] Pasteur won the Leeuwenhoek Medal\nfrom the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences for his contributions to microbiology in\n1895.[\n        \n        ]\nPasteur was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1853, promoted to Officer in 1863, to\nCommander in 1868, to Grand Officer in 1878 and made a Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor in\n1881.[\n        \n        ][147]\nLegacy\n      worldwide, streets are\nnamed in his honor.

The official statute was registered in 1887, stating that the institute's\npurposes were \"the treatment of rabies according to the method developed by M. Pasteur\" and \"the\nstudy of virulent and contagious diseases\".[\n          \n          ] The institute was inaugurated on 14 November\n1888.[\n          \n          ] He brought together scientists with various specialties. The first five departments were\ndirected by two graduates of the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure: \u00c9mile Duclaux (general microbiology\nresearch) and Charles Chamberland (microbe research applied to hygiene), as well as a biologist,\n\u00c9lie Metchnikoff (morphological microbe research) and two physicians, Jacques-Joseph Grancher\n(rabies) and \u00c9mile Roux (technical microbe research). One year after the inauguration of the\ninstitute, Roux set up the first course of microbiology ever taught in the world, then entitled Cours\nde Microbie Technique (Course of microbe research techniques). Since 1891 the Pasteur Institute\nhad been extended to different countries, and currently there are 32 institutes in 29 countries in\nvarious parts of the world.[159]\n        ", "Personal life": "\n        Faith and spirituality\nPasteur married Marie Pasteur (n\u00e9e Laurent) in 1849. She was the daughter of the rector of the\nUniversity of Strasbourg, and was Pasteur's scientific assistant. They had five children together,\nonly three of whom survived until adulthood. [160]\nHis grandson, Louis Pasteur Vallery-Radot, wrote that Pasteur had kept from his Catholic\nbackground only a spiritualism without religious practice.[\n        \n        ] However, Catholic observers often\nsaid that Pasteur remained an ardent Christian throughout his whole life, and his son-in-law wrote,\nin a biography of him:\nAbsolute faith in God and in Eternity, and a conviction that the power for good given to\nus in this world will be continued beyond it, were feelings which pervaded his whole\nlife; the virtues of the gospel had ever been present to him. Full of respect for the form\nof religion which had been that of his forefathers, he came simply to it and naturally for\nspiritual help in these last weeks of his life.[162]\nThe Literary Digest of 18 October 1902 gives this statement from Pasteur that he prayed while he\nworked:\n      modern materialistic philosophers. The more I\nstudy nature, the more I stand amazed at the work\nof the Creator. I pray while I am engaged at my\nwork in the laboratory.\n          law of Pasteur and outspoken Catholic, also holds that Pasteur\nfundamentally remained Catholic.[163] According to both\nPasteur Vallery-Radot and Maurice Vallery-Radot, the\nfollowing well-known quotation attributed to Pasteur is\napocryphal:[164] \"The more I know, the more nearly is my faith\nthat of the Breton peasant. Could I but know all I would have\nthe faith of a Breton peasant's wife\".[18] According to Maurice\nVallery-Radot,[165] the false quotation appeared for the first\ntime shortly after the death of Pasteur.[166] However, despite\nhis belief in God, it has been said that his views were that of a\nfreethinker rather than a Catholic, a spiritual more than a\nreligious man.[167][168] He was also against mixing science\nwith religion.[169][170]\nDeath\nPasteur in 1857\nIn 1868, Pasteur suffered a severe brain stroke that paralysed the left side of his body, but he\nrecovered.[171] A stroke or uremia in 1894 severely impaired his health.[172][173][174] Failing to fully\nrecover, he died on 28 September 1895, near Paris.[\n          \n          ] He was given a state funeral and was buried\nin the Cathedral of Notre Dame, but his remains were reinterred in the Pasteur Institute in\nParis,[175] in a vault covered in depictions of his accomplishments in Byzantine mosaics.[176]\n        ", "Publications": "Pasteur's principal published works are:[18]French Title\nEtudes sur le Vin\nEtudes sur le Vinaigre\nEtudes sur la Maladie des Vers \u00e0 Soie (2 volumes)\nQuelques R\u00e9flexions sur la Science en France\nEtudes sur la Bi\u00e8re\nLes Microbes organis\u00e9s, leur r\u00f4le dans la Fermentation, la\nPutr\u00e9faction et la Contagion\nDiscours de R\u00e9ception de M.L.

The\nfamily moved to Marnoz in 1826 and then to Arbois in 1827.[\n            \n            ][\n            \n            ]\nPasteur entered primary school in 1831.[\n            \n            ]\nHe was an average student in his early years, and not particularly\nacademic, as his interests were fishing and sketching.[18] He drew\nmany pastels and portraits of his parents, friends and neighbors.[\n            \n            ]\nPasteur attended secondary school at the Coll\u00e8ge d'Arbois.[\n            \n            ] In\nOctober 1838, he left for Paris to join the Pension Barbet, but became\nhomesick and returned in November.[\n            \n            ]\nThe house in which Pasteur\nwas born, Dole\nIn 1839, he entered the Coll\u00e8ge Royal at Besan\u00e7on to study philosophy and earned his Bachelor of\nLetters degree in 1840.[\n            \n            ] He was appointed a tutor at the Besan\u00e7on college while continuing a\ndegree science course with special mathematics.[\n            \n            ] He failed his first examination in 1841. He\nmanaged to pass the baccalaur\u00e9at scientifique (general science) degree from Dijon, where he\nearned his Bachelor of Science in Mathematics degree (Bachelier \u00e8s Sciences Math\u00e9matiques) in\n1842,[\n            \n            ] but with a mediocre grade in chemistry.[\n            \n            ]\nLater in 1842, Pasteur took the entrance test for the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure.[\n            \n            ] He passed the\nfirst set of tests, but because his ranking was low, Pasteur decided not to continue and try again\nnext year.[\n            \n            ] He went back to the Pension Barbet to prepare for the test. He also attended classes\nat the Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Louis and lectures of Jean-Baptiste Dumas at the Sorbonne.[\n            \n            ] In 1843, he\npassed the test with a high ranking and entered the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure.[\n            \n            ] In 1845 he\nreceived the licenci\u00e9 \u00e8s sciences degree.[\n            \n            ] In 1846, he was appointed professor of physics at the\nColl\u00e8ge de Tournon (now called Lyc\u00e9e Gabriel-Faure) in Ard\u00e8che. But the chemist Antoine J\u00e9r\u00f4me\nBalard wanted him back at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure as a graduate laboratory assistant\n(agr\u00e9g\u00e9 pr\u00e9parateur).[\n            \n            ] He joined Balard and simultaneously started his research in\ncrystallography and in 1847, he submitted his two thesis, one in chemistry and the other in\nphysics.- (a) Chemistry Thesis: \"Recherches sur la capacit\u00e9 de saturation de l'acide ars\u00e9nieux.\nEtudes des ars\u00e9nites de potasse, de soude et d'ammoniaque.\"; (b) Physics Thesis: \"1. \u00c9tudes des\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes relatifs \u00e0 la polarisation rotatoire des liquides. 2.

They were married on 29 May 1849,[36] and together had five\nchildren, only two of whom survived to adulthood;[37] the other three died of typhoid.\n          ", "In Pasteur's early work as a chemist, beginning at the \u00c9cole": "\n          Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and continuing at Strasbourg and Lille,\nhe examined the chemical, optical and crystallographic\nproperties of a group of compounds known as tartrates.[46]\nHe resolved a problem concerning the nature of tartaric acid in\n1848.[47][48][49][\n          \n          ] A solution of this compound derived from\nliving things rotated the plane of polarization of light passing\nthrough it.[46] The problem was that tartaric acid derived by\nchemical synthesis had no such effect, even though its\nchemical reactions were identical and its elemental\ncomposition was the same.[\n          \n          ]\nPasteur noticed that crystals of tartrates had small faces. Then\nhe observed that, in racemic mixtures of tartrates, half of the\ncrystals were right-handed and half were left-handed. In\nsolution, the right-handed compound was dextrorotatory, and\nthe left-handed one was levorotatory.[46] Pasteur determined\nthat optical activity related to the shape of the crystals, and\nthat an asymmetric internal arrangement of the molecules of the compound was responsible for\ntwisting the light.[39] The (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)- tartrates were isometric, non-superposable mirror\nimages of each other. This was the first time anyone had demonstrated molecular chirality, and\nalso the first explanation of isomerism.[46]\nSome historians consider Pasteur's work in this area to be his \"most profound and most original\ncontributions to science\", and his \"greatest scientific discovery.\"[46]\nFermentation and germ theory of diseases\nPasteur was motivated to investigate fermentation while working at Lille. In 1856 a local wine\nmanufacturer, M. Bigot, whose son was one of Pasteur's students, sought for his advice on the\nproblems of making beetroot alcohol and souring.[\n          \n          ][7]\nAccording to his son-in-law, Ren\u00e9 Vallery-Radot, in August 1857 Pasteur sent a paper about lactic\nacid fermentation to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Sciences de Lille, but the paper was read three months\nlater.[\n          \n          ] A memoire was subsequently published on 30 November 1857.[\n          \n          ] In the memoir, he\ndeveloped his ideas stating that: \"I intend to establish that, just as there is an alcoholic ferment, the\nyeast of beer, which is found everywhere that sugar is decomposed into alcohol and carbonic acid,\nso also there is a particular ferment, a lactic yeast, always present when sugar becomes lactic\nacid.\"[\n          \n          ]\nPasteur also wrote about alcoholic fermentation.[\n          \n          ] It was published in full form in 1858.[\n          \n          ][\n          \n          ]\nJ\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius and Justus von Liebig had proposed the theory that fermentation was caused\nby decomposition. Pasteur demonstrated that this theory was incorrect, and that yeast was\nresponsible for fermentation to produce alcohol from sugar.[\n          \n          ] He also demonstrated that, when a\ndifferent microorganism contaminated the wine, lactic acid was produced, making the wine sour.[7]\nIn 1861, Pasteur observed that less sugar fermented per part of yeast when the yeast was exposed to\nair.[\n          \n          ] The lower rate of fermentation aerobically became known as the Pasteur effect.[\n          \n          ]\nPasteur's research also\nshowed that the growth of\nmicro-organisms was\nresponsible for spoiling\nbeverages, such as beer,\nwine and milk. With this\nestablished, he invented a\nprocess in which liquids\nsuch as milk were heated\nto a temperature between\n60 and 100 \u00b0C.[\n          \n          ] This\nkilled most bacteria and\nmoulds already present\nPasteur experimenting in his within them. Pasteur and\nlaboratory. Claude Bernard completed\ntests on blood and urine\non 20 April 1862.[\n          \n          ]\nPasteur patented the process, to fight the \"diseases\" of wine, in\n1865.[\n          \n          ] The method became known as pasteurization, and\nwas soon applied to beer and milk.[\n          \n          ]\nInstitut Pasteur de Lille\nBeverage contamination led Pasteur to the idea that micro-organisms infecting animals and\nhumans cause disease. He proposed preventing the entry of micro-organisms into the human body,\nleading Joseph Lister to develop antiseptic methods in surgery.[\n          \n          ]\nIn 1866, Pasteur published Etudes sur le Vin, about the diseases of wine, and he published Etudes\nsur la Bi\u00e8re in 1876, concerning the diseases of beer.[\n          \n          ]\nIn the early 19th century, Agostino Bassi had shown that muscardine was caused by a fungus that\ninfected silkworms.[\n          \n          ] Since 1853, two diseases called p\u00e9brine and flacherie had been infecting\ngreat numbers of silkworms in southern France, and by 1865 they were causing huge losses to\nfarmers. In 1865, Pasteur went to Al\u00e8s and worked for five years until 1870.[\n          \n          ][\n          \n          ]\nSilkworms with p\u00e9brine were covered in corpuscles. In the first three years, Pasteur thought that\nthe corpuscles were a symptom of the disease. In 1870, he concluded that the corpuscles were the\ncause of p\u00e9brine (it is now known that the cause is a microsporidian).[\n          \n          ] Pasteur also showed that\nthe disease was hereditary.[\n          \n          ] Pasteur developed a system to prevent p\u00e9brine: after the female\nmoths laid their eggs, the moths were turned into a pulp. The pulp was examined with a\nmicroscope, and if corpuscles were observed, the eggs were destroyed.[\n          \n          ][\n          \n          ] Pasteur concluded\nthat bacteria caused flacherie. The primary cause is currently thought to be viruses.[\n          \n          ] The spread\nof flacherie could be accidental or hereditary. Hygiene could be used to prevent accidental\nflacherie. Moths whose digestive cavities did not contain the microorganisms causing flacherie\nwere used to lay eggs, preventing hereditary flacherie.[\n          \n          ]\nSpontaneous generation\n        ", "Following his fermentation experiments, Pasteur": "demonstrated that the skin of grapes was the natural source of\nyeasts, and that sterilized grapes and grape juice never\nfermented. He drew grape juice from under the skin with\nsterilized needles, and also covered grapes with sterilized cloth.\nBoth experiments could not produce wine in sterilized\ncontainers.[7]", "His findings and ideas were against the prevailing notion of": "\n          spontaneous generation. He received a particularly stern\ncriticism from F\u00e9lix Archim\u00e8de Pouchet, who was director of\nthe Rouen Museum of Natural History. To settle the debate\nbetween the eminent scientists, the French Academy of\nSciences offered the Alhumbert Prize carrying 2,500 francs to\nwhoever could experimentally demonstrate for or against the\ndoctrine.[\n          \n          ][\n          \n          ][\n          \n          ]\n        ", "Pouchet stated that air everywhere could cause spontaneous": "\n          generation of living organisms in liquids.[\n          \n          ] In the late 1850s,\nhe performed experiments and claimed that they were\nevidence of spontaneous generation.[\n          \n          ][\n          \n          ] Francesco Redi and\nLazzaro Spallanzani had provided some evidence against\nspontaneous generation in the 17th and 18th centuries,\nrespectively. Spallanzani's experiments in 1765 suggested that\nair contaminated broths with bacteria. In the 1860s, Pasteur\nrepeated Spallanzani's experiments, but Pouchet reported a\ndifferent result using a different broth.[\n          \n          ]\n        ", "Pasteur performed several experiments to disprove": "\n          spontaneous generation. He placed boiled liquid in a flask and\nlet hot air enter the flask. Then he closed the flask, and no\norganisms grew in it.[\n          \n          ] In another experiment, when he\nopened flasks containing boiled liquid, dust entered the flasks,\nBottle en col de cygne (swan-neck\nbottle) used by Pasteur\nLouis Pasteur?s pasteurization\nexperiment illustrates the fact that\nthe spoilage of liquid was caused by\nparticles in the air rather than the air\nitself. These experiments were\nimportant pieces of evidence\nsupporting the germ theory of\ndisease.\ncausing organisms to grow in some of them. The number of flasks in which organisms grew was\nlower at higher altitudes, showing that air at high altitudes contained less dust and fewer\norganisms.[7][\n          \n          ] Pasteur also used swan neck flasks containing a fermentable liquid. Air was\nallowed to enter the flask via a long curving tube that made dust particles stick to it. Nothing grew\nin the broths unless the flasks were tilted, making the liquid touch the contaminated walls of the\nneck. This showed that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, on dust,\nrather than spontaneously generating within the liquid or from the action of pure air.[7][\n          \n          ]\nThese were some of the most important experiments disproving the theory of spontaneous\ngeneration. Pasteur gave a series of five presentations of his findings before the French Academy of\nSciences in 1881, which were published in 1882 as M\u00e9moire Sur les corpuscules organis\u00e9s qui\nexistent dans l'atmosph\u00e8re: Examen de la doctrine des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations spontan\u00e9es (Account of\nOrganized Corpuscles Existing in the Atmosphere: Examining the Doctrine of Spontaneous\nGeneration).[\n          \n          ][\n          \n          ] Pasteur won the Alhumbert Prize in 1862.[\n          \n          ] He concluded that:\nNever will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow of this\nsimple experiment. There is no known circumstance in which it can be confirmed that\nmicroscopic beings came into the world without germs, without parents similar to\nthemselves.[7][\n          \n          ]\nImmunology and vaccination\n        \n            Pasteur's first work on vaccine development was on chicken cholera. He received the bacteria\nsamples (later called Pasteurella multocida after him) from Henry Toussaint.[\n            \n            ] He started the\nstudy in 1877, and by the next year, was able to maintain a stable culture using broths.[\n            \n            ] After\nanother year of continuous culturing, he found that the bacteria were less pathogenic. Some of his\nculture samples could no longer induce the disease in healthy chickens. In 1879, Pasteur, planning\nfor holiday, instructed his assistant, Charles Chamberland to inoculate the chickens with fresh\nbacteria culture. Chamberland forgot and went on holiday himself. On his return, he injected the\nmonth-old cultures to healthy chickens. The chickens showed some symptoms of infection, but\ninstead of the infections being fatal, as they usually were, the chickens recovered completely.\nChamberland assumed an error had been made, and wanted to discard the apparently faulty\nculture, but Pasteur stopped him.[82][\n            \n            ] Pasteur injected the freshly recovered chickens with fresh\nbacteria (that normally would kill other chickens), the chickens no longer showed any sign of\ninfection. It was clear to him that the weakened bacteria had caused the chickens to become\nimmune to the disease.[\n            \n            ][\n            \n            ]\nIn December 1880, Pasteur presented his results to the French Academy of Sciences as \"Sur les\nmaladies virulentes et en particulier sur la maladie appel\u00e9e vulgairement chol\u00e9ra des poules (On\nvirulent diseases, and in particular on the disease commonly called chicken cholera)\" and\npublished it in the academy's journal (Comptes-Rendus hebdomadaires des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie\ndes Sciences). He attributed that the bacteria were weakened by contact with oxygen.[\n            \n            ] He\nexplained that bacteria kept in sealed containers never lost their virulence, and only those exposed\nto air in culture media could be used as vaccine. Pasteur introduced the term \"attenuation\" for this\nweakening of virulence as he presented before the academy, saying:\n          \n            We can diminish the microbe?s virulence by changing the mode of culturing. This is the\ncrucial point of my subject. I ask the Academy not to criticize, for the time being, the\nconfidence of my proceedings that permit me to determine the microbe?s attenuation,\nin order to save the independence of my studies and to better assure their progress...\n[In conclusion] I would like to point out to the Academy two main consequences to the\nfacts presented: the hope to culture all microbes and to find a vaccine for all infectious\ndiseases that have repeatedly afflicted humanity, and are a major burden on agriculture\nand breeding of domestic animals.[\n            \n            ]\n          \n            In the 1870s, he applied this immunization method to anthrax, which affected cattle, and aroused\ninterest in combating other diseases. Pasteur cultivated bacteria from the blood of animals infected\nwith anthrax. When he inoculated animals with the bacteria, anthrax occurred, proving that the\nbacteria was the cause of the disease.[\n            \n            ] Many cattle were dying of anthrax in \"cursed fields\".[\n            \n            ]\nPasteur was told that sheep that died from anthrax were buried in the field. Pasteur thought that\nearthworms might have brought the bacteria to the surface. He found anthrax bacteria in\nearthworms' excrement, showing that he was correct.[\n            \n            ] He told the farmers not to bury dead\nanimals in the fields.[\n            \n            ] Pasteur had been trying to develop the anthrax vaccine since 1877, soon\nafter Robert Koch's discovery of the bacterium.[\n            \n            ]\nOn 12 July 1880, Henri Bouley read before the French Academy of Sciences a report from Henry\nToussaint, a veterinary surgeon, who was not member of the academy. Toussaint had developed\nanthrax vaccine by killing the bacilli by heating at 55\u00b0C for 10 ?minutes. He tested on eight dogs and\n11 sheep, half of which died after inoculation. It was not a great success. Upon hearing the news,\nPasteur immediately wrote to the academy that he could not believe that dead vaccine would work\nand that Toussaint's claim \"overturns all the ideas I had on viruses, vaccines, etc.\"[\n            \n            ] Following\nPasteur's criticism, Toussaint switched to carbolic acid to kill anthrax bacilli and tested the vaccine\non sheep in August 1880. Pasteur thought that this type of killed vaccine should not work because\nhe believed that attenuated bacteria used up nutrients that the bacteria needed to grow. He\nthought oxidizing bacteria made them less virulent.[\n            \n            ]\nBut Pasteur found that anthrax bacillus was not easily weakened by culturing in air as it formed\nspores ? unlike chicken cholera bacillus. In early 1881, he discovered that growing anthrax bacilli\nat about 42 \u00b0C made them unable to produce spores,[\n            \n            ] and he described this method in a speech\nto the French Academy of Sciences on 28 February.[\n            \n            ] On 21 March, he announced successful\nvaccination of sheep. To this news, veterinarian Hippolyte Rossignol proposed that the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nd'agriculture de Melun organize an experiment to test Pasteur's vaccine. Pasteur signed agreement\nof the challenge on 28 April. A public experiment was conducted in May at Pouilly-le-Fort. 58\nsheep, 2 goats and 10 cattle were used, half of which were given the vaccine on 5 and 17 May; while\nthe other half was untreated.[\n            \n            ] All the animals were injected with the fresh virulent culture of\nanthrax bacillus on 31 May. The official result was observed and analysed on 2 June in the presence\nof over 200 spectators. All cattle survived, vaccinated or not, as Pasteur had bravely predicted: \"I\nhypothesized that the six vaccinated cows would not become\nvery ill, while the four unvaccinated cows would perish or at\nleast become very ill.\"[\n            \n            ] On the other hand, all vaccinated\nsheep and goats survived, while the unvaccinated one either\nhad died or were dying before the viewers.[\n            \n            ] His report to the\n          \n            French Academy of Sciences on 13 June condludes:\nLouis Pasteur in his laboratory,\npainting by A.

In 1879, Pasteur, planning\nfor holiday, instructed his assistant, Charles Chamberland to inoculate the chickens with fresh\nbacteria culture. Chamberland forgot and went on holiday himself. On his return, he injected the\nmonth-old cultures to healthy chickens. The chickens showed some symptoms of infection, but\ninstead of the infections being fatal, as they usually were, the chickens recovered completely.\nChamberland assumed an error had been made, and wanted to discard the apparently faulty\nculture, but Pasteur stopped him.[82][\n            \n            ] Pasteur injected the freshly recovered chickens with fresh\nbacteria (that normally would kill other chickens), the chickens no longer showed any sign of\ninfection. It was clear to him that the weakened bacteria had caused the chickens to become\nimmune to the disease.[\n            \n            ][\n            \n            ]\nIn December 1880, Pasteur presented his results to the French Academy of Sciences as \"Sur les\nmaladies virulentes et en particulier sur la maladie appel\u00e9e vulgairement chol\u00e9ra des poules (On\nvirulent diseases, and in particular on the disease commonly called chicken cholera)\" and\npublished it in the academy's journal (Comptes-Rendus hebdomadaires des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie\ndes Sciences). He attributed that the bacteria were weakened by contact with oxygen.[\n            \n            ] He\nexplained that bacteria kept in sealed containers never lost their virulence, and only those exposed\nto air in culture media could be used as vaccine. Pasteur introduced the term \"attenuation\" for this\nweakening of virulence as he presented before the academy, saying:\n          \n            We can diminish the microbe?s virulence by changing the mode of culturing. This is the\ncrucial point of my subject. I ask the Academy not to criticize, for the time being, the\nconfidence of my proceedings that permit me to determine the microbe?s attenuation,\nin order to save the independence of my studies and to better assure their progress...\n[In conclusion] I would like to point out to the Academy two main consequences to the\nfacts presented: the hope to culture all microbes and to find a vaccine for all infectious\ndiseases that have repeatedly afflicted humanity, and are a major burden on agriculture\nand breeding of domestic animals.[\n            \n            ]\n          ", "Anthrax": "\n            In the 1870s, he applied this immunization method to anthrax, which affected cattle, and aroused\ninterest in combating other diseases. Pasteur cultivated bacteria from the blood of animals infected\nwith anthrax. When he inoculated animals with the bacteria, anthrax occurred, proving that the\nbacteria was the cause of the disease.[\n            \n            ] Many cattle were dying of anthrax in \"cursed fields\".[\n            \n            ]\nPasteur was told that sheep that died from anthrax were buried in the field. Pasteur thought that\nearthworms might have brought the bacteria to the surface. He found anthrax bacteria in\nearthworms' excrement, showing that he was correct.[\n            \n            ] He told the farmers not to bury dead\nanimals in the fields.[\n            \n            ] Pasteur had been trying to develop the anthrax vaccine since 1877, soon\nafter Robert Koch's discovery of the bacterium.[\n            \n            ]\nOn 12 July 1880, Henri Bouley read before the French Academy of Sciences a report from Henry\nToussaint, a veterinary surgeon, who was not member of the academy. Toussaint had developed\nanthrax vaccine by killing the bacilli by heating at 55\u00b0C for 10 ?minutes. He tested on eight dogs and\n11 sheep, half of which died after inoculation. It was not a great success. Upon hearing the news,\nPasteur immediately wrote to the academy that he could not believe that dead vaccine would work\nand that Toussaint's claim \"overturns all the ideas I had on viruses, vaccines, etc.\"[\n            \n            ] Following\nPasteur's criticism, Toussaint switched to carbolic acid to kill anthrax bacilli and tested the vaccine\non sheep in August 1880. Pasteur thought that this type of killed vaccine should not work because\nhe believed that attenuated bacteria used up nutrients that the bacteria needed to grow. He\nthought oxidizing bacteria made them less virulent.[\n            \n            ]\nBut Pasteur found that anthrax bacillus was not easily weakened by culturing in air as it formed\nspores ? unlike chicken cholera bacillus. In early 1881, he discovered that growing anthrax bacilli\nat about 42 \u00b0C made them unable to produce spores,[\n            \n            ] and he described this method in a speech\nto the French Academy of Sciences on 28 February.[\n            \n            ] On 21 March, he announced successful\nvaccination of sheep. To this news, veterinarian Hippolyte Rossignol proposed that the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nd'agriculture de Melun organize an experiment to test Pasteur's vaccine. Pasteur signed agreement\nof the challenge on 28 April. A public experiment was conducted in May at Pouilly-le-Fort. 58\nsheep, 2 goats and 10 cattle were used, half of which were given the vaccine on 5 and 17 May; while\nthe other half was untreated.[\n            \n            ] All the animals were injected with the fresh virulent culture of\nanthrax bacillus on 31 May. The official result was observed and analysed on 2 June in the presence\nof over 200 spectators. All cattle survived, vaccinated or not, as Pasteur had bravely predicted: \"I\nhypothesized that the six vaccinated cows would not become\nvery ill, while the four unvaccinated cows would perish or at\nleast become very ill.\"[\n            \n            ] On the other hand, all vaccinated\nsheep and goats survived, while the unvaccinated one either\nhad died or were dying before the viewers.[\n            \n            ] His report to the\n          \n            French Academy of Sciences on 13 June condludes:\nLouis Pasteur in his laboratory,\npainting by A.

Inoculation with smallpox (variolation) was known\nto result in a much less severe disease, and greatly reduced mortality, in comparison with the\nnaturally acquired disease.[\n          \n          ] Edward Jenner had also studied vaccination using cowpox\n(vaccinia) to give cross-immunity to smallpox in the late 1790s, and by the early 1800s vaccination\nhad spread to most of Europe.[\n          \n          ]\nThe difference between smallpox vaccination and anthrax or chicken cholera vaccination was that\nthe latter two disease organisms had been artificially weakened, so a naturally weak form of the\ndisease organism did not need to be found.[\n          \n          ] This discovery revolutionized work in infectious\ndiseases, and Pasteur gave these artificially weakened diseases the generic name of \"vaccines\", in\nhonour of Jenner's discovery.[\n          \n          ]\nIn 1876, Robert Koch had shown that Bacillus anthracis caused anthrax.[\n          \n          ] In his papers\npublished between 1878 and 1880, Pasteur only mentioned Koch's work in a footnote. Koch met\nPasteur at the Seventh International Medical Congress in 1881. A few months later, Koch wrote\nthat Pasteur had used impure cultures and made errors. In 1882, Pasteur replied to Koch in a\nspeech, to which Koch responded aggressively.[15] Koch stated that Pasteur tested his vaccine on\nunsuitable animals and that Pasteur's research was not properly scientific.[7] In 1882, Koch wrote\n\"On the Anthrax Inoculation\", in which he refuted several of Pasteur's conclusions about anthrax\nand criticized Pasteur for keeping his methods secret, jumping to conclusions, and being imprecise.\nIn 1883, Pasteur wrote that he used cultures prepared in a similar way to his successful\nfermentation experiments and that Koch misinterpreted statistics and ignored Pasteur's work on\nsilkworms.[\n          \n          ]\n        \n            In 1882, Pasteur sent his assistant Louis Thuillier to southern France because of an epizootic of\nswine erysipelas.[100] Thuillier identified the bacillus that caused the disease in March 1883.[\n            \n            ]\nPasteur and Thuillier increased the bacillus's virulence after passing it through pigeons.
